# Chapter 1 - Overview of Security Concepts
## Lesson 1 - Overview of the Most Common Threats

There is a growing list of threats for web developers. Keeping up on all security issues must be on your mind daily. Beyond this course you need to continue reading and learning about the common techniques and tools to prevent these issues.

[OWASP - The Open Worldwide Application Security Project](https://owasp.org), is a great place to start to research the latest threats. 

Prevention should always be your number one priority, rather than dealing with an attack after the fact.

The most common security risks are as follows.
- Cross-site Scripting  (XSS)<br>
  This is when a malicious script is injected into a site, typically through a form or field.
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)<br>
  This is any form of malicious code that is executed when a user is authenticated to a trusted website.
- Sensitive Data Exposure<br>
  More often than not APIs don't properly protect sensitive information and therefore easily provide opportunities for identity theft and other bad information leaks.
- Injection Attacks<br>
  This occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- Obfuscation<br>
  This simply means when someone is hiding their purpose, like putting on a disguise.
